# SmartFarm API Planning Document

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Author**: AI Assistant  
**Version**: 1.0

## 1. Project Scope

### Core Functionality

1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication (JWT)
   - Farmer profile management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Crop Management**
   - Track crop details and growth stages
   - Record planting and harvest dates
   - Monitor crop health and status

3. **Supply Chain Integration**
   - Supplier information management
   - Input tracking (seeds, fertilizers, etc.)
   - Purchase history

4. **Market Intelligence**
   - Current market prices for crops
   - Price trends and analytics
   - Market alerts and notifications

5. **Yield Prediction**
   - Machine learning-based yield forecasts
   - Historical yield analysis
   - Risk assessment

6. **Support System**
   - Help request ticketing
   - FAQ and knowledge base
   - Community support features

### Out of Scope

1. Payment processing
2. Direct messaging between users
3. Mobile app development (API-only for now)
4. Complex GIS mapping (beyond basic location tracking)

## 2. Technical Risks

### High Risk

1. **Data Accuracy**
   - Yield predictions depend on quality input data
   - Market prices may have latency or inaccuracies

2. **Scalability**
   - Large volumes of sensor/IoT data in production
   - Concurrent user access during peak farming seasons

3. **Integration**
   - Third-party weather data APIs
   - Mobile app integration
   - Payment gateway integration (future)

### Mitigation Strategies

- Implement data validation and cleaning
- Use caching for frequently accessed data
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Thorough testing of third-party integrations

## 3. Assumptions

### Technical

1. Users will have basic internet connectivity
2. Mobile devices will be the primary access method
3. Data can be stored in a relational database
4. API will be consumed by web and mobile clients

### Business

1. Farmers will regularly update crop information
2. Market price data will be available from reliable sources
3. Users will have basic smartphone literacy
4. Local language support may be required for expansion

## 4. Dependencies

1. Django REST Framework
2. PostgreSQL (for production)
3. Redis (for caching)
4. Celery (for background tasks)
5. TensorFlow/PyTorch (for ML models)

## 5. Future Considerations

1. Mobile app development
2. IoT device integration
3. Advanced analytics dashboard
4. Multi-language support
5. Offline functionality

## 6. Success Metrics

1. Number of active farmers
2. Accuracy of yield predictions
3. API response times
4. User engagement metrics
5. Help request resolution time
